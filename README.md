# Overwatch-Soldier-76-No-Recoil-2021
A simple AHK script to largely cancel the recoil of Soldier 76's rifle. 

Run the script via AHK. You can resume or pause the script by pressing F2. 
The gun recoil could be largely cancelled (but not entirely) to provide better precision. Feel free to modify the moveAmount variable to change the recoil suppression, but 1.9 was tested to be the relatively optimal value for a steady aim.
